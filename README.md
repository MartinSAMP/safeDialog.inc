safeDialog is a lightweight PAWN include for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) that protects your server from dialog spam and abuse. It provides an easy-to-use drop-in replacement for the native dialog functions, adding intelligent cooldown management, automatic spam detection, and temporary blocking of offending players.
